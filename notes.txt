- The cable class:
  Not sure how to improve this yet. Now, each house has a Cable object. These
  Cable objects have a list with all segments of the route. This should be
  easier. Storing cables in the district as a dictionary perhaps.

- Creating all routes for the random begin state:
  Not a big of a change but I want to write this down before I forget: FIRST
  assign houses to batteries (repeat until valid solution), only THEN create
  all routes from house to batteries. Does not make sense to create routes only
  to remove them again because the solution is not valid.

- Create routes:
  What I want is for routes to overlap with other cable segments. How? A* is not
  working: very long (and ugly) code, not fast. Need something simpler.

        Short code idea for vertical_horizontal routes:
        coordinates = []
        coordinates.append((house_x, house_y))
        coordinates.append((battery_x, house_y))
        coordinates.append((battery_x, battery_y))

    - Just need to make segments out of this. Or think of another way to
      calculate shared cost. Maybe connect houses with other cables instead of
      always planning a route towards a battery, then we can just calculate the
      length of all cables.

    - If this is figured out, the hill climber and simulated annealing will work
      much better. 


- Need a file to save districts with the best solutions before we lose them all
